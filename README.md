# EmailBuddy

A Chrome extension that adds ChatGPT to your email


## Install

First clone this repo on your local machine

Then install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run the server so the extension can communicate with ChatGPT.

```bash
node server.js
```

Add the extension

1. Go to chrome://extensions in your Google Chrome browser
2. Check the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner
3. Click "Load Unpacked" to see a file-selection dialog
4. Select your local EmailBuddy/extension directory (I need to make this folder)




To Do: Lots

But mostly, connecting to their API or using this [chatgpt-api](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api) open source API.
